0:00:00.000,0:00:03.120
[Doğukan] How would you describe Burak Yiğit Kaya to someone who never met you?

0:00:03.640,0:00:05.320
Crazy about computers. That's it.

0:00:05.820,0:00:11.900
Crazy about computers since childhood, someone who loves helping other people.. That's what I'd say for myself.

0:00:11.900,0:00:13.340
[Doğukan] How did you start development?

0:00:13.920,0:00:18.600
When I was around of age 9 or 10, I'd say, my father finally bought a Commodore 64.

0:00:19.020,0:00:24.460
I mean developing code. Otherwise, I think, I stuck around with computers since I was 3 or 4. My cousin's family were financially better at the time

0:00:24.460,0:00:26.740
and they had this 386 or 486 or something.

0:00:27.260,0:00:30.900
I was typing DOS commands back then. And I was badgering my dad "[buy a] computer, computer".

0:00:30.900,0:00:32.200
And finally they bought this Commodore 64 for me.

0:00:32.200,0:00:37.480
He told me: "Look, this thing is BASIC's compiler, interpreter"

0:00:37.840,0:00:40.560
"READY." it says, waiting for you to type in commands...

0:00:41.360,0:00:46.080
And there my father told me: "Look", he said, "...by typing `INPUT N$` you can get user input"

0:00:46.080,0:00:48.340
I was writing silly calculators

0:00:48.340,0:00:52.560
If you just typed `3+5` the machine already does the addition but we were asking like "please type your operation type" etc..

0:00:53.140,0:00:56.900
That's how I started. And then I got a scholarship at a private school

0:00:57.140,0:01:04.240
There I met Windows 95, the web, JavaScript, HTML etc.. Some guy suggested me to work on those things back then.

0:01:04.240,0:01:08.140
Around 2nd or 3rd grade in middle school I started to seriously work with JavaScript.

0:01:08.220,0:01:09.400
[Doğukan] In which year were you born in?

0:01:09.400,0:01:15.940
I was born in 88. I guess I wrote my first JavaScript code around 2001 but they are not on the internet.

0:01:16.360,0:01:19.540
I was writing terrible and silly codes. There was limited internet connection,

0:01:19.540,0:01:24.020
no search engines at all, Google either wasn't working great or didn't exist at all. It was a time like that.

0:01:24.200,0:01:27.580
And I was trying to learn JavaScript from these stupid books that just collected code samples from the internet.

0:01:27.960,0:01:32.060
I met this friend at my first year in high school. He was a geek as well with those books etc..

0:01:32.300,0:01:33.040
[Doğukan] Was he in İzmir as well?

0:01:33.460,0:01:35.140
No. In fact I came to İzmir years later. People think that...

0:01:35.280,0:01:36.380
[Doğukan] Where are you originally from then?

0:01:36.380,0:01:38.780
It's in fact where I was born and grown in: Kocaeli, Yalova.

0:01:40.140,0:01:43.560
And this friend also lived in Yalova. His name is Tuna Akın; let me take the opportunity to say hi to him.

0:01:44.820,0:01:46.100
We still talk, though seldom.

0:01:46.580,0:01:50.560
He... He thought me Delphi. He had this huge book. He was like "There's this thing called Delphi" etc...

0:01:50.560,0:01:52.940
I looked at that; back then, CSS was quite new on the web.

0:01:53.380,0:01:56.400
Laying things out visually was horribly hard. Delphi had a graphical form editor where you just pull things...

0:01:56.400,0:01:57.040
[Doğukan] Drag & drop...

0:01:57.040,0:01:59.640
Drag & drop... And I said: "My god, What a wonderful thing this is!"

0:01:59.960,0:02:02.040
Meanwhile my friend was also learning Assembly.

0:02:02.860,0:02:07.600
He was showing me these Assembly codes like `mov ax, bx` etc. and I said: "what the hell? This isn't computer code, this is weird and ridiculous!"

0:02:07.900,0:02:10.320
Anyways... We got deeper into these things.

0:02:10.680,0:02:12.500
Then I started working for a company on my freshman year at the university.

0:02:13.920,0:02:15.580
[Doğukan] What did you study?

0:02:15.580,0:02:17.060
Mechanical Engineering.

0:02:17.440,0:02:18.100
[Doğukan] Mechanical Engineering...

0:02:18.100,0:02:18.800
Yes...

0:02:19.200,0:02:21.060
[Doğukan] Can you tell us about the US and Disqus?

0:02:21.340,0:02:24.480
Just completed my military obligation. Wanting to get married with my now-wife. We were already engaged.

0:02:24.480,0:02:27.620
It was actually almost marking our second year of our engagement by the time I got out from military.

0:02:27.620,0:02:29.700
1.5 years... I think it was either 1 or 1.5 years.

0:02:29.940,0:02:36.080
And I was looking for a job. I was constantly applying to Google, Twitter etc. while I was at college.

0:02:36.080,0:02:37.420
Of course, none responded.

0:02:37.880,0:02:43.540
Anyways... Then things started to change in a good way. Right around the end of my time in military... As if they were too
requiring candidates to have no military obligation just like in Turkey.

0:02:43.540,0:02:48.380
Companies started to respond. Disqus was the 2nd. We started the interview process...

0:02:48.380,0:02:52.440
We quickly completed the first 2 stages in December but then there was Christmas.

0:02:52.440,0:02:58.680
They told me that they'd like me to visit their offices for an on-site after Christmas.

0:02:58.680,0:03:04.040
I said OK, perfect! Then we got to this intense, 6-7 hour-long interview.

0:03:04.040,0:03:08.020
I was jet lagged, saying things like "huh? whaa?" to everything. And it's my first trip to the US afterall, a totally different place.

0:03:08.660,0:03:14.300
Then I got the job. Of course we had to wait for the visa for a long time.

0:03:14.300,0:03:15.900
That's why I started working earlier in April. I mean as a contractor, from remote.

0:03:16.420,0:03:22.560
When April came and things such as my immediate future, income etc. were a bit more certain, I told my wife: "ok, let's get married".

0:03:22.560,0:03:24.000
At least we could now see ahead.

0:03:24.000,0:03:24.500
[Doğukan] Hmm... Got it.

0:03:24.500,0:03:28.280
We hurriedly decided this on April. Even towards the very end of April actually.

0:03:28.280,0:03:29.880
And then got married in the middle of July.

0:03:30.180,0:03:34.880
We might not even be able to find a venue for the wedding. But luckily [we did]... We got married on a Monday for this reason.

0:03:34.880,0:03:37.180
People were asking: "What are you doing? Who marries on a Monday?!"

0:03:37.180,0:03:41.580
We didn't have a place to live. And we didn't want to settle either since we were going to move in a few months.

0:03:41.580,0:03:45.500
Therefore we found a furnished flat with one bedroom. Moved in.

0:03:46.000,0:03:48.080
Then I flew to the US, before my wife.

0:03:48.900,0:03:53.580
My wife lived there until the end of the year. I flew out in October. For the first 1 or 2 months...

0:03:53.580,0:03:56.080
...I lived in a sketchy, terrifying neighbourhood called the Mission District. It was in fact Mission & 16th Street

0:03:56.080,0:03:58.920
Those who've been to San Francisco before would kow it. A horrible place to live.

0:03:59.720,0:04:00.840
I lived there for 2 months.

0:04:01.640,0:04:04.080
In fact the initial plan was to live there for a month and find a permanent place to live but I couldn't find anything.

0:04:04.220,0:04:06.280
It's so hard to find place to live, let alone affordable.

0:04:06.280,0:04:11.520
But I managed to find a place in a nice neighbourhood called the Marina District. No homeless people, much... Again, single bedroom.

0:04:12.100,0:04:13.980
But it was beautiful and expensive as hell.

0:04:14.520,0:04:18.480
Anyways... I put all my belongings from that damn place into those IKEA bags.

0:04:19.020,0:04:20.740
Those blue, thick bags...

0:04:21.260,0:04:23.920
Then called a cab, put everything into the trunk and left

0:04:23.920,0:04:25.920
while thinking: "Fuck this place".

0:04:26.620,0:04:28.180
Then I got back to Turkey

0:04:28.920,0:04:29.600
to bring my to US with me.

0:04:29.860,0:04:31.580
Then... we moved out.

0:04:32.460,0:04:33.020
We had like...

0:04:33.460,0:04:36.380
3-4 pieces of luggage or even 5... Not 5 but 4, I guess.

0:04:36.380,0:04:39.840
No... in fact it was 5. I mean 5 pieces of luggage full of my wive's belongings.

0:04:40.780,0:04:44.900
When we were at the airport, the Turkish Airlines rep teased me: "Which one is yours?"

0:04:44.900,0:04:47.560
And then said: "Haha! Ladies of course have the bigger ones, don't they?"

0:04:47.560,0:04:50.740
I couldn't tell her that actually all of it belonged to my wife...

0:04:51.340,0:04:53.120
Err then... Then we left the country.

0:04:55.120,0:04:57.940
It all started that way. I mean even the moving in part was painful.

0:04:57.940,0:05:01.380
And then when we arrived, there's no furniture at all. I told my my wife "I wanted to pick everything together..."

0:05:02.080,0:05:04.280
Then we went to IKEA, but without a car. Thought about renting one

0:05:04.280,0:05:08.860
but we decided not to for some reason. Maybe we were afraid of having trouble with the new traffic rules, I don't know.

0:05:08.860,0:05:11.540
We rode a bus to IKEA. Again buying things with lots of bags.

0:05:11.840,0:05:14.400
Things like utensils, pots etc...

0:05:14.860,0:05:16.140
It was an interesting adventure.

0:05:16.460,0:05:21.620
[Doğukan] This is like everyone's dream... I mean, to go to United States, work for a company there, awesomely.

0:05:22.000,0:05:27.160
[Doğukan] Why, on the contrary, you gave up this everyone's awesome dream and decided to move back?

0:05:27.400,0:05:31.480
Well, my wife had to resign from her job in Turkey in order to come [to the states] with me.

0:05:32.020,0:05:36.400
I didn't know what my net income would be. You only know your gross income then they deduce the taxes etc.

0:05:36.900,0:05:40.560
Once we arrived, we quickly found out that rents are more expensive and my income was less than what we assumed.

0:05:40.960,0:05:43.120
I mean we have proceeded towards the worce scenarios in our predictions.

0:05:43.800,0:05:46.920
Now we needed to find a job for my wife and her arrival was towards the end of January.

0:05:47.760,0:05:53.800
She would have to find a job and apply for an H1B by April so that she could start working on October same year.

0:05:54.400,0:05:58.460
Her English isn't bad at all but we also didn't know whether it was enough to work there or not.

0:05:59.580,0:06:03.380
And all the people I knew there were from the developer community but she was rather an Electronics Engineer.

0:06:03.380,0:06:06.520
She used to work as a Test Engineer. We failed to find a good fit for her.

0:06:07.080,0:06:10.780
Around the end of our 2nd month, I mean around March, we found out that...

0:06:11.660,0:06:13.540
it's not going to happen this year.

0:06:15.060,0:06:18.940
Then we looked at our expenses. My wife wanted to go to a language school mostly to get into a community, have some local friends.

0:06:18.940,0:06:20.700
It made perfect sense, but it was expensive.

0:06:21.420,0:06:22.220
Erm.. And then the rent was pretty high.

0:06:23.180,0:06:25.980
Our monthly expenses were pretty high.

0:06:26.120,0:06:29.940
You know what? One night she cooked menemen (eggs scrambled with tomatoes and onion) when I came home. It is the poor man's dinner here in Turkey, right?

0:06:30.460,0:06:34.940
I swear to God, the total cost of it to us was about $12 or $15!

0:06:35.380,0:06:36.860
Because just even a single tomato costs around $1!

0:06:36.940,0:06:39.460
I mean expenses were an important factor. And the second was...

0:06:39.800,0:06:41.140
...the lack of a working opportunity for my wife. I mean...

0:06:41.360,0:06:42.800
She's been working for years.

0:06:43.620,0:06:47.260
She comes to this new place and there's no hope for a job for at least 1.5 years. And even after then, there is no guarentee either.

0:06:47.260,0:06:48.840
It was pretty exhausting.

0:06:48.980,0:06:53.860
So when we couldn't see clear ahead, she said: "Look, my ex company just had this opening. Maybe I'll go back?"

0:06:54.340,0:06:57.140
I had to say "OK". "Do whatever you need and I'll see what I can do..."

0:06:57.140,0:06:59.380
[Doğukan] Does your wife also work on software or what?

0:06:59.380,0:07:03.060
Well, she graduated from electronics [engineering]. She worked as a QA Engineer at some factories.

0:07:03.060,0:07:05.920
Now she works for Ericsson as a Test Engineer and she used to do the same back then.

0:07:07.140,0:07:09.980
Let's say she's multi functional. But she mainly works on quality assurance.

0:07:10.680,0:07:13.980
I mean, as I've said... We could have found a position for her if we tried hard. But even then,

0:07:14.440,0:07:19.120
there is this cultural differences such as food etc... She couldn't really adapt. Neither did I. You notice when you're back.

0:07:19.120,0:07:21.320
I mean when I was here... I have this thing.

0:07:21.640,0:07:23.140
I can used to something pretty uncomfortable.

0:07:23.540,0:07:27.100
Even if that uncofrtable thing starts bugging me I tend to not realize this. I'm like life just goes on and it's sometimes cruel

0:07:27.100,0:07:29.380
or whatever and you're a bit sad about it but you don't really notice it that much etc.

0:07:29.680,0:07:33.960
When you come back and experience that relaxation, the comfort like the place I live in for instance.

0:07:34.320,0:07:38.460
The first thing that struck me when I got back and moved in was... I get up at night to get some water from the kitchen and I'm like "My god, this place is huge, I keep walking and walking to the damn kitchen!"

0:07:39.140,0:07:42.700
I mean... I know these are, like, small details but they affect your life a lot when you start to experience them every single day.

0:07:42.980,0:07:43.480
[Doğukan] Right.

0:07:43.900,0:07:48.000
"Look...", I told my employer, "...my wife has returned. And I'll be in trouble soon if I don't as well."

0:07:48.000,0:07:49.360
I mean it's not sustainable.

0:07:49.660,0:07:53.260
But, "I am...", I said, "...pretty happy for working with you. Instead of going back and doing something else,

0:07:53.260,0:07:55.580
let's keep going since we've tried working remotely before [and it worked]."

0:07:55.580,0:07:58.600
Meanwhile, I was of course, discussing this with my team lead as well, asking his opinions.

0:07:58.600,0:08:02.960
He said "It'd be OK for us even if you work at half the efficiency you do right now. You should be good so just relax."

0:08:03.460,0:08:07.320
I agreed and then discussed the details. Actually, they wanted to keep me around until September.

0:08:07.320,0:08:11.080
I said: "Look, we have our anniversary on July so let me be there; let the family reunite." etc.

0:08:11.480,0:08:15.960
Thankfuly, they said "OK". And since then, which has been almost 2.5 years now...

0:08:16.920,0:08:18.340
[Doğukan] Living in İzmir?
[Burak] Without any trouble. Living in İzmir.

0:08:18.340,0:08:21.120
Of course I go to the US from time to time but that doesn't exceed 1 or 2 weeks.

0:08:21.420,0:08:27.940
[Doğukan] How do you spend a day now at Disqus? Of course I mean at home when I say "at Disqus"... How exactly do you spend your day?

0:08:27.940,0:08:31.640
I get up in the morning. My phone lays beside me always. So I check my emails even before leaving the bed.

0:08:31.640,0:08:35.020
There's always [something], even if there's nothing directly in inbox, these updates etc.

0:08:35.020,0:08:38.640
like this patch got approved, or that patch got rejected, there was a problem in this system etc...

0:08:38.640,0:08:40.900
Lots of, several e-mails I get. At least.

0:08:41.220,0:08:45.380
I try to delete as much of them after quickly reading them. Then I get up.

0:08:45.560,0:08:50.260
If I feel energetic, good, I get to my computer right away, without breakfast, with my pijamas on, just as I get up...

0:08:50.380,0:08:50.900
[Doğukan] Awesome!

0:08:51.480,0:08:54.460
Awesome yourself, let's hear what your wife thinks about it? Anyways...

0:08:55.080,0:09:00.880
So I sit... First I try to deal with the code review requests...

0:09:01.220,0:09:05.380
Then I look at my task list. Usually there are at least a few things to work on so I spend my time working on them.

0:09:05.420,0:09:09.260
[Doğukan] Can we say you're the guy leading the frontend team?

0:09:09.320,0:09:12.640
Yes we can but I started to drift off from that position a bit.

0:09:12.760,0:09:18.360
I mean I'm mostly providing infrastructure now. And that's also the thing that lead me to become the lead eventually.

0:09:18.360,0:09:22.940
I mean, I used to be a front-end product engineer, developing interfaces etc... But nowadays I try to improve our infrastructure,

0:09:22.940,0:09:25.920
like how to have better models in Backbone. Recently we have created something called UniqueModel.

0:09:25.920,0:09:28.940
For example, things like improving the infrastructure of our realtime system...

0:09:29.200,0:09:31.980
...or how to improve the build system, how can we make it faster; I work on things like these.

0:09:32.200,0:09:36.060
I still work on similar things while leading the team and I also do technical leadership to the front-end team members.

0:09:36.060,0:09:38.360
I mean advising people like "we should head this way", "we should do it like this" etc...

0:09:38.700,0:09:43.440
I'm not talking about assigning tasks, managing people like how it's usually perceived in Turkey, not like a boss.

0:09:43.440,0:09:44.020
[Doğukan] Got it.

0:09:44.120,0:09:45.840
[Doğukan] What motivates you?

0:09:45.980,0:09:47.700
I really love helping people.

0:09:47.900,0:09:51.640
Including helping people on the street to helping anyone in general...

0:09:51.640,0:09:55.120
Erm... In my daily life, I also have the love of my life since my childhood...

0:09:55.120,0:10:00.060
I mean love of my life, apologies to my wife but erm... It's my computer after her.

0:10:00.460,0:10:01.480
Programming

0:10:01.840,0:10:06.100
In fact I'm a very lazy guy, really. Instead of doing anything that requires moving my butt

0:10:06.100,0:10:10.920
"so, can I make something do this for me? May be I could write some code?" I couldn't really continue doing mechanical engineering mostly because of this.

0:10:10.920,0:10:15.440
What motivates me is... I mean I love coding. I love being lazy.

0:10:15.440,0:10:19.960
I also love helping people so I found this developer efficiency thing that best combines both.

0:10:19.960,0:10:24.600
I write my code, being lazy, and save other people some effort or labor.

0:10:24.740,0:10:26.900
[Doğukan] What is your development environment like?

0:10:27.080,0:10:31.960
[Doğukan] I think we can start with your operating system of choice. Because there are some strong prejudices about that.

0:10:31.960,0:10:37.780
[Doğukan] There are these people who tell Windows users "Boy, are you using Windows? Go use Linux. Mac is the best" or things like that.

0:10:37.780,0:10:40.380
I'm Burak Yiğit Kaya and I use Windows 10 and I'm pretty happy with it.

0:10:41.700,0:10:43.300
I mean, joking asdie, yes, I use Windows.

0:10:43.980,0:10:45.760
[Doğukan] And what do you use as your terminal?

0:10:46.040,0:10:49.940
I'm using something called ConEmu. It's probably the biggest reason that keeps me on Windows.

0:10:49.940,0:10:51.820
I mean if I didn't discover it, I probably wouldn't be using Windows today.

0:10:52.160,0:10:55.000
Erm, and as for the IDE, I'm using PyCharm for a long time.

0:10:55.280,0:10:58.960
And as for my side IDE, I mean for small things, I used to use nano but nowadays I'm using vim.

0:10:59.120,0:11:04.520
And I recently started using Visual Studio Code for some small, not so big projects.

0:11:04.520,0:11:08.980
I recommend Spotify if you aren't already using it. Previously I was using Google Music but Spotify is better.

0:11:10.620,0:11:12.620
I think the font a developer uses is very important.

0:11:12.760,0:11:16.020
I came across a font family called Meslo LG, it's lovely.

0:11:16.180,0:11:18.800
I now prefer Telegram over things like Whatsapp or Hangouts.

0:11:19.260,0:11:22.620
Besides those I don't think I can recommend much else. Oh, and of course there is, erm, f-lux.

0:11:22.620,0:11:27.140
I'm sure there are many people using it. It's written as "f.lux", it warms up your screen at night

0:11:27.140,0:11:29.140
so that your eyes won't hurt due to white light.

0:11:29.300,0:11:30.800
[Doğukan] What kinds of music do you listen while you're working?

0:11:31.300,0:11:34.100
I like listening to Jazz which makes me more relaxed and focused.

0:11:34.820,0:11:39.300
If I'm excited or happy, I prefer hard rock or even metal some times

0:11:39.300,0:11:43.220
but metal can soemtimes make me confused since it is a bit too energetic after a point.

0:11:44.260,0:11:47.620
If I'm feeling tranquil or if I feel elite, I prefer classic music.

0:11:47.620,0:11:52.800
But I came to realise that classic music has so many nuances in it which forces you to pay more

0:11:52.800,0:11:57.640
attention to the music rather than the code. That's why I rather prefer those

0:11:57.640,0:11:59.900
piano-heavy music they play in the backround in Jazz bars. I like them better.

0:12:00.700,0:12:07.600
[Doğukan] I know you're not a designer but, as a front-end developer, do you know what the equivalent of 1 "click" in pixels is?

0:12:07.880,0:12:09.960
That's a very... That's a very subjective question.

0:12:09.960,0:12:14.480
Dude, to me, a click is a single pixel. I mean when you say a click, it could be 2 pixels as well

0:12:14.480,0:12:17.860
on those, since we now have these retina displays but I'm not really sure... For me one click is one pixel.

0:12:18.080,0:12:22.520
But when someone talks about a click, they probably mean 5 to 10 pixels, I think.

0:12:22.740,0:12:23.760
[Doğukan] Thanks.

0:12:24.640,0:12:26.640
[Doğukan] What do you think about open source?

0:12:26.800,0:12:29.440
I think they have a philosophy that can change the world.

0:12:29.660,0:12:36.140
I'm not talking about the vision Stallman has where he means everything should be open and free. I'm rather more pragmatic about it.

0:12:36.400,0:12:40.320
I mean I'm thinking about code into which everyone can contribute.

0:12:40.700,0:12:45.820
I think a lot about this and, I think, in the future, this idea will form the basis of a more participatory

0:12:45.820,0:12:49.800
democracy and executive-legislative matters. This is a bit too much philosophy and politics here but makes sense when you think about it.

0:12:49.800,0:12:56.860
I mean it's a quite good example for democrasy thanks to its all open nature and the newly adopted things like

0:12:56.860,0:13:01.700
Code of Conduct. And also for working in partnership.

0:13:01.920,0:13:05.540
Imagine as... There needs a public restroom built out there. I mean, it's a weird example but anyways...

0:13:05.900,0:13:09.540
This one constructor says: "we wanna build a public restroom for three people here. We managed to complete these parts

0:13:09.540,0:13:12.900
but there are incomplete parts here and there." While you're passing by you look and say: "Oh, I know about construction, I think I can help"

0:13:12.900,0:13:16.080
You work for it like 1 or 2 hours. Then someone else comes and says: "cool, i like this!"

0:13:16.320,0:13:19.300
And one other says: "let's do it this way" etc. I think open source is like this.

0:13:19.620,0:13:24.120
And the second best part is this... When I apply for a new job and if I have lots of open source contributions

0:13:24.120,0:13:30.260
I don't have to do anything. I'd say: "Go, check my GitHub repo. Look at my resume. I did this and that." I'm able to show what I did.

0:13:30.260,0:13:33.500
In contrast, right now at Disqus, I say "I did this and I did that" for various projects that are not open source

0:13:33.500,0:13:34.540
but they just have to take my word for it.

0:13:34.540,0:13:35.140
[Doğukan] Yeah.

0:13:35.500,0:13:38.740
And I can't even show them my code. However when it is open source I just say: "Go, check it out. It's all there, all my work.

0:13:38.740,0:13:41.180
Take it or leave it". That's it.

0:13:42.460,0:13:46.400
And you get to know lots of people. It had an effect close to what social media [first] did.

0:13:46.400,0:13:51.980
For example, Nicholas Zakas is someone who I admire since when I was young, that I follow and respect.

0:13:52.420,0:13:58.040
When contributing to the ESLint project now, erm... I have the chance to talk to him directly.

0:13:58.040,0:14:01.880
He takes me seriously. He listens to my ideas. I'm able to hear his thoughts right from himself.

0:14:02.120,0:14:04.540
I think this is incredible. Something that brings people together.

0:14:05.280,0:14:08.640
And for this, I try to contribute to open source whenever I can.

0:14:09.300,0:14:11.100
[Doğukan] What's your inflection point?

0:14:11.360,0:14:14.600
Probably that time after completing my military obligation. Or, let's say, when I started it.

0:14:14.600,0:14:18.840
Yeah, the time I started, because I couldn't find anything to do, despite the fact that I was an ensign

0:14:18.840,0:14:22.340
I told myself... And they told me "You're a Mechanical Engineering and that's why we're bringing you to this base"

0:14:22.340,0:14:23.820
but then assigned me no tasks.

0:14:24.120,0:14:29.440
I found this internet computer. Since I didn't have anything to do, I started contributing to Mozilla's MDN wiki.

0:14:29.680,0:14:33.040
Things have changed dramatically for me since then.

0:14:33.040,0:14:35.540
Before that companies didn't respond at all. They started after this.

0:14:35.540,0:14:40.420
And during this time they invited me to JSConf EU, thanks to Mozilla. When I saw the environment I thought:

0:14:40.420,0:14:43.700
"I should do this stuff, I should follow these communities more".

0:14:43.960,0:14:45.380
Then things changed.

0:14:45.500,0:14:47.340
[Doğukan] Do you have an unforgettable, curious story?

0:14:47.500,0:14:48.880
[Burak] I do.
[Doğukan] What is it?

0:14:49.200,0:14:51.080
Well my unforgettable, curious story is how I met my wife.

0:14:51.080,0:14:56.100
I was writing code when I was at high school. An encryption program called NT-Cryptor written Delphi.

0:14:56.100,0:14:58.620
You can even find it online on some weird sites such as gezginler.com.

0:14:59.740,0:15:03.800
Then I put it online. Put my name into its about section as well as my 2 e-mail addresses.

0:15:04.020,0:15:07.080
Back then there was MSN. Very widely used. One of those e-mail addresses was, in fact, my MSN address.

0:15:07.080,0:15:08.500
Anyways, I put it there.

0:15:08.820,0:15:13.200
My wife is older than me by the way. She was working on her thesis at the time. And I was a freshman.

0:15:13.720,0:15:18.320
And her thesis was on encryption. She finds my encryption tool, sees my name and adds me on MSN.

0:15:18.700,0:15:23.660
She's about to remove... She would remove me very soon, thinking "this guy wouldn't even talk to me", close her account, we never ever talk again.

0:15:23.900,0:15:30.220
By chance, we have this technical drawing course that day. We go to the lab and I suspect there is a security vulnerability on those computers.

0:15:30.500,0:15:33.200
I have this disk, called NT Password Reset Disk, with me.

0:15:33.660,0:15:38.360
When you boot the computer with that disk, it boots with Linux

0:15:38.360,0:15:40.240
and allows you to reset the admin password by fiddling with NT's encrypted parts.

0:15:40.960,0:15:42.960
Otherwise you cannot do anything on that computer besides the drawing app.

0:15:43.320,0:15:45.680
So I have my disk and I reset the password.

0:15:46.180,0:15:50.860
I now have access to the desktop, change the wallpaper, show off to my friends asking "which wallpaper, this or that?" etc...

0:15:50.860,0:15:55.840
Then I install MSN, get online. And right at that moment, she sees me online right before she was about to sign off.

0:15:56.280,0:15:56.780
[Doğukan] Awesome!

0:15:56.840,0:16:01.780
There we start to talk and now we're married. And we know each other for 10 years.

0:16:01.780,0:16:03.620
[Doğukan] Awesome, perfect!
[Burak] Yes, it's an interesting story.

0:16:04.580,0:16:09.940
[Doğukan] What do you do outside work? I mean... I'm asking this because Burak Can had this blog post,

0:16:09.940,0:16:13.940
[Doğukan] saying we get together, organise meetups etc... But it's always about work, work, work..

0:16:13.940,0:16:19.480
[Doğukan] Don't you do anything else?" while tagging Fatih and other guys on it.

0:16:19.480,0:16:24.120
[Doğukan] So I was inspired by that for this question. I assume you don't always work. I mean, I hope you don't?

0:16:24.300,0:16:26.840
[Doğukan] Erm, so do you have anything that you do or like outside work?

0:16:27.160,0:16:31.320
LEGO. Despite my age, I still love playing with LEGO. And, second, there is photography.

0:16:31.840,0:16:35.040
Sometimes I play some music by myself. I've this tiny electronic drum kit at home.

0:16:35.040,0:16:38.020
And I love cycling. Thankfully, I started doing it again, recently.

0:16:39.020,0:16:39.620
And that's it for now...

0:16:39.780,0:16:45.420
It's been a while since I met Doğukan. I'm following his work closely. I think these developer talks video series is a very nice idea.

0:16:45.420,0:16:50.260
Therefore, erm, you should click here and subscribe.

0:16:50.620,0:16:52.620
Follow him and I'll also be following.

0:16:52.620,0:16:54.620
[Doğukan] Thanks.
