0:00:00.000,0:00:03.120
[Doğukan] How would you describe Burak Yiğit Kaya to someone you never met?

0:00:03.640,0:00:05.320
A geek. That'd be it.

0:00:05.820,0:00:11.900
A geek since childhood, someone who loves helping other people.. I'd say for myself.

0:00:11.900,0:00:13.340
[Doğukan] How did you start developing code?

0:00:13.920,0:00:18.600
When I was around an age of 9-10, I'd say, my father finally bought a Commodor 64.

0:00:19.020,0:00:24.460
I mean developing code. Otherwise, I think, I stuck around with computers since I was 3 or 4. My cousin's family were
in a better situation at the time

0:00:24.460,0:00:26.740
and they had this 386 or 486, whatever.

0:00:27.260,0:00:30.900
I was typing DOS commands back then. And I was pressuring my father to buy me one.

0:00:30.900,0:00:32.200
And he had to buy me a Commodor 64 in the end.

0:00:32.200,0:00:37.480
He told me: "Look, this thing is BASIC's interpreter.."

0:00:37.840,0:00:40.560
"Ready.." it said waiting for you to type in commands..

0:00:41.360,0:00:46.080
And there my father told me: "Look..", he said, "..this is the input, n and $ etc.. and you get the input that way"

0:00:46.080,0:00:48.340
I was trying to write silly calculators as my first programs.

0:00:48.340,0:00:52.560
The thing was able to show you the result when you just types 3+5 but we were asking for the input in a fancy way
like "please type your input" etc..

0:00:53.140,0:00:56.900
That's how I started. And then I got a scholarship in a college

0:00:57.140,0:01:04.240
where I first met Windows 95, the web, JavaScript, HTML etc.. Some guy suggested me to work on those things back then.

0:01:04.240,0:01:08.140
Around 2nd or 3rd grade in middle school I was mainly focused on JavaScript.

0:01:08.220,0:01:09.400
[Doğukan] In which year were you born?

0:01:09.400,0:01:15.940
I was born in 88. So that means I wrote my first JavaScript code around 2001 but you can find none of them online.

0:01:16.360,0:01:19.540
Of course those codes were horrible. There was limited internet connection,

0:01:19.540,0:01:24.020
no search engines at all, Google either didn't exist or wasn't working at all. It was a time like that.

0:01:24.200,0:01:27.580
And I was trying to learn JavaScript from patchy, stupid sample books.

0:01:27.960,0:01:32.060
I met a friend at 1st grade in high school. He was a geek as well with those books etc..

0:01:32.300,0:01:33.040
[Doğukan] Was he in İzmir as well?

0:01:33.460,0:01:35.140
No. In fact I came to İzmir years later. People think that...

0:01:35.280,0:01:36.380
[Doğukan] Where are you from originally then?

0:01:36.380,0:01:38.780
It's in fact where I was born and grown in: Kocaeli, Yalova.

0:01:40.140,0:01:43.560
And this friend of mine also lived in Yalova. His name is Tuna Akın; let me take the opportunity to say hi to him.

0:01:44.820,0:01:46.100
We still hang out time to time.

0:01:46.580,0:01:50.560
He had this huge book about Delphi and taught me about it.

0:01:50.560,0:01:52.940
Back then, CSS was relatively new for web.

0:01:53.380,0:01:56.400
Moving things around was incredibly tough. Delphi had a graphical form editor where you just pull things...

0:01:56.400,0:01:57.040
[Doğukan] Drag & drop..

0:01:57.040,0:01:59.640
Yeah, drag & drop.. And I said: "Gosh! What a wonderful thing is this!"

0:01:59.960,0:02:02.040
Meanwhile my friend was also learning Assembly.

0:02:02.860,0:02:07.600
Showing me Assembly codes like mod ax bx etc. and I said: "wait what? this isn't computer code, this is ridiculous!"

0:02:07.900,0:02:10.320
Anyways.. We just got deeper into these things.

0:02:10.680,0:02:12.500
Then I started working for a company while I was 1st grade at the university.

0:02:13.920,0:02:15.580
[Doğukan] What did you study?

0:02:15.580,0:02:17.060
Mechanical Engineering.

0:02:17.440,0:02:18.100
[Doğukan] Mechanical Engineering...

0:02:18.100,0:02:18.800
Yes..

0:02:19.200,0:02:21.060
[Doğukan] Can you tell us about America and Disqus?

0:02:21.340,0:02:24.480
I have just completed military obligation. Wanted to get married, I was already engaged.

0:02:24.480,0:02:27.620
We were already past the 2nd year of our engagement at the end of my time in military.

0:02:27.620,0:02:29.700
It was either 1 or 1.5 years, I guess.

0:02:29.940,0:02:36.080
And I was looking for a job. I was constantly applying to Google, Twitter etc. while I was in the university.

0:02:36.080,0:02:37.420
Of course none of them responded.

0:02:37.880,0:02:43.540
Anyways.. Then things have changed in a good way, right around the end of my time in military. As if they were
requiring candidates to complete military obligation just like in Turkey.

0:02:43.540,0:02:48.380
Companies started to respond. Disqus was the 2nd. We started the interviews..

0:02:48.380,0:02:52.440
We quickly completed the first 2 stages in December but then there was Christmas holiday.

0:02:52.440,0:02:58.680
They told me that they'd like me to visit their offices for another interview after the Christmas holiday.

0:02:58.680,0:03:04.040
I said OK, perfect! Then we started the interview which was pretty intense and almost took about 6-7 hours.

0:03:04.040,0:03:08.020
I was jet lagged. And it's America afterall, a totally different place.

0:03:08.660,0:03:14.300
I got the job. Of course we had to wait for the visa application for a long time.

0:03:14.300,0:03:15.900
That's why I started working as a remote contractor in April.

0:03:16.420,0:03:22.560
When April came and things such as my situation, wage etc. were certain, I told my wife: "ok, let's get married".

0:03:22.560,0:03:24.000
At least we could now foresee the feature.

0:03:24.000,0:03:24.500
[Doğukan] Hmm.. Got it.

0:03:24.500,0:03:28.280
We hurriedly decided this on April. Maybe even at the end of April.

0:03:28.280,0:03:29.880
And then got married in the middle of July.

0:03:30.180,0:03:34.880
We might not even be able to find a place to get married but luckily we did.. On a Monday!

0:03:34.880,0:03:37.180
People were asking: "What are you doing? Who marries on a Monday?"

0:03:37.180,0:03:41.580
We didn't have a place to live. And we didn't want to settle one since we were about to move.

0:03:41.580,0:03:45.500
Therefore we found a furnitured flat with a single room. Moved in.

0:03:46.000,0:03:48.080
Then I flew to America, beforehand.

0:03:48.900,0:03:53.580
My wife lived there until the end of the year. I flew in October and for 1 or 2 months..

0:03:53.580,0:03:56.080
..I lived in a horrible neighbourhood called Mission District. It was in fact Mission & 16th Street

0:03:56.080,0:03:58.920
for those who have been to San Francisco before. A horrible place.

0:03:59.720,0:04:00.840
I lived there for 2 months.

0:04:01.640,0:04:04.080
In fact the initial plan was to live there for a month and find a place to live but I failed to do so.

0:04:04.220,0:04:06.280
It's so hard to find an affordable place to live.

0:04:06.280,0:04:11.520
But I managed to find a place in a nice neighbourhood called Marina District. No homeless people. Again with a single room.

0:04:12.100,0:04:13.980
But it was beautiful and very very expensive.

0:04:14.520,0:04:18.480
Anyways.. I put all of my things into those IKEA bags.

0:04:19.020,0:04:20.740
Those blue, thick bags..

0:04:21.260,0:04:23.920
Then called a cab, put everything into the trunk and left

0:04:23.920,0:04:25.920
while thinking: "Fuck this place"

0:04:26.620,0:04:28.180
Then I got back to Turkey

0:04:28.920,0:04:29.600
to help my wife while moving out.

0:04:29.860,0:04:31.580
We ended the contract there

0:04:32.460,0:04:33.020
and that's how we moved.

0:04:33.460,0:04:36.380
3 or 4 luggages or even 5..? Not 5 but 4, I guess..

0:04:36.380,0:04:39.840
No, in fact it was 5. I mean 5 luggages full of my wive's belongings.

0:04:40.780,0:04:44.900
When we were at the airport, the Turkish Airlines rep teased me: "Which one is yours?"

0:04:44.900,0:04:47.560
And then said: "Haha! Ladies of course have the bigger ones, don't they?"

0:04:47.560,0:04:50.740
I couldn't tell her that actually all of it belonged to my wife...

0:04:51.340,0:04:53.120
Err then.. Then we left the country.

0:04:55.120,0:04:57.940
It all started that way. I mean even the moving part was a pain in the ass.

0:04:57.940,0:05:01.380
And then since we didn't have any furnitures, I suggested my wife to buy them together.

0:05:02.080,0:05:04.280
And we went to IKEA, but without a car. Thought about renting one

0:05:04.280,0:05:08.860
but we decided not to or maybe we were afraid of having trouble with the new traffic rules, I don't know.

0:05:08.860,0:05:11.540
We rode a bus to IKEA. Again buying things with lots of bags.

0:05:11.840,0:05:14.400
Things like forks, knives, pots etc..

0:05:14.860,0:05:16.140
That was an amazing story..

0:05:16.460,0:05:21.620
[Doğukan] Everyone has this super dream about moving to America and working for a company.

0:05:22.000,0:05:27.160
[Doğukan] Why, on the contrary, you gave up and moved back to Turkey?

0:05:27.400,0:05:31.480
Well, my wife had to resign from her job in Turkey in order to come to America with me.

0:05:32.020,0:05:36.400
I didn't know what my net income would be while moving to US. You only know your gross income then it becomes less after all those taxes etc..

0:05:36.900,0:05:40.560
Once we arrived, we quickly found out that rents are more expensive and my income was less than what we were told.

0:05:40.960,0:05:43.120
I mean our expectations were wrong in a really bad way.

0:05:43.800,0:05:46.920
Now we needed to find a job for my wife but her arrival was the end of January.

0:05:47.760,0:05:53.800
She would have to find a job and apply for H1B before April so that she could start working on October the same year.

0:05:54.400,0:05:58.460
Her English isn't that bad but we didn't know whether it was enough to work there or not.

0:05:59.580,0:06:03.380
And all the people I knew there were from the developer community but she was rather an Electrical Engineer.

0:06:03.380,0:06:06.520
She used to work as a Test Engineer and we failed to find a position for her.

0:06:07.080,0:06:10.780
Around the end of 2nd month, I mean around March, we found out that

0:06:11.660,0:06:13.540
it's not going to work at least this year.

0:06:15.060,0:06:18.940
We looked at our expenses. And she also wanted to go to a language school not just to practice the language but also to have some friends.

0:06:18.940,0:06:20.700
It made sense but it was really expensive.

0:06:21.420,0:06:22.220
Erm.. And rent was pretty high.

0:06:23.180,0:06:25.980
Our monthly expenses were pretty high.

0:06:26.120,0:06:29.940
You know what? One night she cooked menemen when I came home. As you know it's poor man's meal, right?

0:06:30.460,0:06:34.940
I swear to God, the total cost of it to us was about $12 or $15!

0:06:35.380,0:06:36.860
Because just even a tomato costs around $1!

0:06:36.940,0:06:39.460
I mean costs were an important factor. And the second was...

0:06:39.800,0:06:41.140
...the lack of a job for my wife. I mean...

0:06:41.360,0:06:42.800
...after all those years she worked?

0:06:43.620,0:06:47.260
She comes to this new place and cannot even find a job for at least 1.5 years. And there is no guarentee either.

0:06:47.260,0:06:48.840
It was pretty exhausting.

0:06:48.980,0:06:53.860
When we couldn't foresee our future she said: "Look, my ex company just had this opening. Maybe I'll go back?"

0:06:54.340,0:06:57.140
I had to say "OK". "Do whatever you need and I'll see what I can do..."

0:06:57.140,0:06:59.380
[Doğukan] Does your wife also work on software or what?

0:06:59.380,0:07:03.060
Well, she's an Electrical Engineer. She worked as a QA Engineer at some factories.

0:07:03.060,0:07:05.920
Now she works for Ericsson as a Test Engineer and she used to do the same at that time.

0:07:07.140,0:07:09.980
Let's say she's multi functional. But she mainly works on quality assurance.

0:07:10.680,0:07:13.980
I mean, maybe if we pushed hard, we could find a position for her. But then,

0:07:14.440,0:07:19.120
there is this cultural differences such as food etc.. She couldn't adapt. Neither do I. You notice when you're back.

0:07:19.120,0:07:21.320
I mean when I was here.. I had this habit.

0:07:21.640,0:07:23.140
Habit of getting used to anything unhealthy.

0:07:23.540,0:07:27.100
I wasn't so aware even though that habit makes me uncomfortable. Life moves on nontheless and it's sometimes cruel

0:07:27.100,0:07:29.380
You're sad about it but you don't care at the same time.

0:07:29.680,0:07:33.960
When you come back and notice the difference, the comfort. I mean the place I live for instance.

0:07:34.320,0:07:38.460
 The first thing that struck me first when I got back was that I got up at night to drink water in the kitchen and I noticed how big this place was.

0:07:39.140,0:07:42.700
I know these are just small details but it affects your life a lot when you start to live with it.

0:07:42.980,0:07:43.480
[Doğukan] Right.

0:07:43.900,0:07:48.000
So I said to my employer: "Look", I said, "my wife has returned. And I'll be in trouble soon if I don't as well."

0:07:48.000,0:07:49.360
I mean it's not sustainable.

0:07:49.660,0:07:53.260
"But..", I said, "..I'm pretty happy working for you and would love to continue working for you instead of

0:07:53.260,0:07:55.580
working for someone else. I mean things worked out well when I was working remotely, so let's continue with that."

0:07:55.580,0:07:58.600
Meanwhile I was, of course, discussing this with my team lead as well, asking his opinions.

0:07:58.600,0:08:02.960
He said: "It'd be OK for us even if you work half the effort like you do now. You should be good so just relax."

0:08:03.460,0:08:07.320
We agreed and discussed the details. In fact they wanted to keep me staying until September

0:08:07.320,0:08:11.080
but I said: "Look, we have our anniversary on July and I gotta be there. Let the family unite." etc..

0:08:11.480,0:08:15.960
Thankfuly, they were OK with it. And since then, which is 2.5 years by now, we live here...

0:08:16.920,0:08:18.340
[Doğukan] Living in İzmir?
[Burak] Absolutely. Living in İzmir.

0:08:18.340,0:08:21.120
Of course I go to US from time to time but that doesn't exceed 1 or 2 weeks.

0:08:21.420,0:08:27.940
[Doğukan] How do you spend a day when you work for Disqus? Of course I mean at home when I say Disqus.. How do you spend the day?

0:08:27.940,0:08:31.640
I get up in the morning. My phone is right next to me so I check my emails without even leaving the bed.

0:08:31.640,0:08:35.020
Usually there are at least 4-5 emails in my inbox, rather Updates tab,

0:08:35.020,0:08:38.640
about things like an approval of a patch or a deniel because of a certain problem..

0:08:38.640,0:08:40.900
So I read through all of them

0:08:41.220,0:08:45.380
trying to delete whatever I can after a quick gaze and then I get up.

0:08:45.560,0:08:50.260
If I feel good, I start working with my computer right away with my pijamas on and without even having a breakfast..

0:08:50.380,0:08:50.900
[Doğukan] Super!

0:08:51.480,0:08:54.460
Of course it'd be super for you! But what would your wife say about it? Anyways..

0:08:55.080,0:09:00.880
So I sit.. First start to deal with the code review requests.

0:09:01.220,0:09:05.380
Then I look at the backlog. Usually there is a bunch of things to work on so I spend my time working on them.

0:09:05.420,0:09:09.260
[Doğukan] Can we say you're the guy leading the frontend team?

0:09:09.320,0:09:12.640
Yes we can but I started to switch responsibilities.

0:09:12.760,0:09:18.360
I mean I'm more into providing infrastructure now. And that's also the thing that caused me to become the lead eventually.

0:09:18.360,0:09:22.940
I mean, I used to be a frontend developer, developing interfaces etc.. But nowadays I try to improve our infrastructure,

0:09:22.940,0:09:25.920
try to findout better ways of creating models in backbone. Recently we have created something called a UniqueModel.

0:09:25.920,0:09:28.940
For example, things like improving the infrastructure of our realtime system..

0:09:29.200,0:09:31.980
..or fix build pipeline issues, make it faster; things like these.

0:09:32.200,0:09:36.060
I still work on similar things while leading the frontend team for technical stuff.

0:09:36.060,0:09:38.360
I mean consulting people like "we should head this way", "we should do it like this" etc..

0:09:38.700,0:09:43.440
I'm not talking about assigning tasks, managing people like how it's usually perceived in Turkey.

0:09:43.440,0:09:44.020
[Doğukan] Got it.

0:09:44.120,0:09:45.840
[Doğukan] So what motivates you generally?

0:09:45.980,0:09:47.700
I really like helping people.

0:09:47.900,0:09:51.640
Including helping people on the streets or helping anyone in general...

0:09:51.640,0:09:55.120
Erm.. In my daily life, I also have the love of my life since my childhood...

0:09:55.120,0:10:00.060
I mean, apologies to my wife but erm.. It's my computer.

0:10:00.460,0:10:01.480
Programming

0:10:01.840,0:10:06.100
In fact I'm a pretty lazy guy, really. Instead of physically doing something I'd rather say:

0:10:06.100,0:10:10.920
"so, can I make something to do this for me? maybe I could write a code for that?" I couldn't continue to Mechanical Engineering just because of this.

0:10:10.920,0:10:15.440
What motivates me is.. I mean I love coding. I love being lazy.

0:10:15.440,0:10:19.960
I love helping people and since I can do both at the same time the result is this developer efficiency.

0:10:19.960,0:10:24.600
I lazily write my code and therefore saving the unnecessary labor for other people.

0:10:24.740,0:10:26.900
[Doğukan] Can you describe your development environment?

0:10:27.080,0:10:31.960
[Doğukan] Maybe we can start with your operating system of choice. Because there are prejudices about that.

0:10:31.960,0:10:37.780
[Doğukan] That there are these people who are using Windows and they are constantly told: "Why do you use Windows when you have Linux and best of all Mac?"..

0:10:37.780,0:10:40.380
I'm Burak Yiğit Kaya and I love using my Windows and I'm pretty happy with it.

0:10:41.700,0:10:43.300
I'm just kidding, but yes, I'm using Windows.

0:10:43.980,0:10:45.760
[Doğukan] And what do you prefer as your terminal?

0:10:46.040,0:10:49.940
I'm using something called ConEmu. It's maybe the only reason I'm sticking with Windows.

0:10:49.940,0:10:51.820
I mean if I didn't have it, I probably wouldn't use Windows today.

0:10:52.160,0:10:55.000
Erm, and as for the IDE, I'm using PyCharm.

0:10:55.280,0:10:58.960
And as for my side IDE, I mean for small things, I used to use nano but nowadays I'm using vim.

0:10:59.120,0:11:04.520
And I recently started to use Visual Studio Code for some small, not so big projects.

0:11:04.520,0:11:08.980
I recommend Spotify if you don't already use it. Previously I was using Google Music but Spotify is much better.

0:11:10.620,0:11:12.620
I think fonts are really important things for any developer.

0:11:12.760,0:11:16.020
Recently I came across a font family called Meslo LG, it's lovely.

0:11:16.180,0:11:18.800
I now prefer Telegram over things like Whatsapp or Hangouts..

0:11:19.260,0:11:22.620
Besides those I don't think I can recommend anything at all. And of course there is, erm, f-lux.

0:11:22.620,0:11:27.140
I'm sure there are many people using it. It's written as "f.lux", it singes the screen at night

0:11:27.140,0:11:29.140
so that your eyes won't hurt due to the white light.

0:11:29.300,0:11:30.800
[Doğukan] What kinds of music do you listen while you work?

0:11:31.300,0:11:34.100
I like listening to Jazz which makes me more relaxed and focused.

0:11:34.820,0:11:39.300
If I'm excited or happy, I prefer hard rock or even metal some times

0:11:39.300,0:11:43.220
but metal confuses me. Maybe because of the tempo.

0:11:44.260,0:11:47.620
If I'm relaxed or if I feel elite, I prefer classic music.

0:11:47.620,0:11:52.800
But recently I came to realise that classic music has too many details in it which forces you to pay more
Ama şunu farkettim; yani klasik müziğin detayı çok fazla olduğu için aslında kod yazarken dinlemeye çalışınca

0:11:52.800,0:11:57.640
attention to the music rather than the code. That's why I rather prefer that

0:11:57.640,0:11:59.900
piano based music they play in Jazz bars. I like them better.

0:12:00.700,0:12:07.600
[Doğukan] I know you're not a designer but, as a Frontend Developer, do you know what the equivalent of 1 click in pixels is?

0:12:07.880,0:12:09.960
That's a unique question..

0:12:09.960,0:12:14.480
In my opinion a click is a single pixel. I mean when you say a click it could be 2 pixels as well

0:12:14.480,0:12:17.860
since we now have the retina displays but I'm not really sure. For me it's just a single pixel.

0:12:18.080,0:12:22.520
But when someone talks about a click, it probably means 5 or 10 pixels, I think.

0:12:22.740,0:12:23.760
[Doğukan] Thanks.

0:12:24.640,0:12:26.640
[Doğukan] What do you think about open source?

0:12:26.800,0:12:29.440
I think they have a philosophy that changes the world.

0:12:29.660,0:12:36.140
I'm not talking about the vision Stallman has where he means everything should be open and free. I'm rather pragmatic about it.

0:12:36.400,0:12:40.320
I mean I'm thinking about code into which everyone can contribute.

0:12:40.700,0:12:45.820
Actually I think about this a lot. I think that, in the future, this idea will form the basis of a more participatory

0:12:45.820,0:12:49.800
democrasy and execution-legislation issues. This is a bit philosophy and politics but makes sense when you think about it.

0:12:49.800,0:12:56.860
I mean it's a quite good example for democrasy thanks to its open nature and the newly adopted things like
Yani herkese her zaman açık ve bu yeni benimsenmeye başlanan Code of Conduct dedikleri şeyler sayesinde

0:12:56.860,0:13:01.700
Code of Conduct. And for working in partnership.

0:13:01.920,0:13:05.540
Imagine you want to build a public toilet. I mean, it's a weird example but anyways..

0:13:05.900,0:13:09.540
The constructor says: "We're build 3 public toilets here. We managed to complete these parts

0:13:09.540,0:13:12.900
but there are incomplete parts here and there." While you're passing by you say: "Oh, I know about construction, I think I can help"

0:13:12.900,0:13:16.080
You work for it like 1 or 2 hours. Then someone else comes and say: "cool, i like this!"

0:13:16.320,0:13:19.300
And he says: "let's do it this way" etc.. I think open source is like this.

0:13:19.620,0:13:24.120
And the second best part is this.. When I apply for a new job and if I have lots of open source contributions

0:13:24.120,0:13:30.260
I don't even have to do anything. I'd say: "Go, check my GitHub repo. Look at me resume. I did this and that". I'm able to show what I did.

0:13:30.260,0:13:33.500
In fact I have to say "I did this and that" in various closed source projects at Disqus

0:13:33.500,0:13:34.540
and the employer has to believe in what I claim.

0:13:34.540,0:13:35.140
[Doğukan] Yes.

0:13:35.500,0:13:38.740
And I can't even show them the code. However if it was open source I'd easily say: "Go, check it out..

0:13:38.740,0:13:41.180
..these are all my contributions. Take it or leave it." And that's it.

0:13:42.460,0:13:46.400
And you gotta know a lot of people. Nearly the same effect social media has.

0:13:46.400,0:13:51.980
For example, Nicholas Zakas is someone who I admire since my childhood, that I follow and respect.

0:13:52.420,0:13:58.040
When I contribute to the ES project, I have the opportunity to talk to him one on one.

0:13:58.040,0:14:01.880
He takes me serious, listens to my ideas. I'm able to hear his thoughts right from himself.

0:14:02.120,0:14:04.540
I think this is incredible. Something that unites people.

0:14:05.280,0:14:08.640
And therefore I try my best to contribute whatever I can to open source.

0:14:09.300,0:14:11.100
[Doğukan] What's your breaking point?

0:14:11.360,0:14:14.600
Probably the time after my military obligation. Or when I started it, I'd say.

0:14:14.600,0:14:18.840
Yes, the time I started. Because I couldn't find anything to do (despite I was a sub-lieutenant

0:14:18.840,0:14:22.340
and them telling me "You're a Mechanical Engineering and that's why we're bringing you on board"

0:14:22.340,0:14:23.820
they assigned me no tasks.)

0:14:24.120,0:14:29.440
I had an internet connected computer. Since I didn't have anything to do, I started contributing to Mozilla's MDN wiki.

0:14:29.680,0:14:33.040
Things have changed dramatically for me since then.

0:14:33.040,0:14:35.540
Before that companies didn't respond at all. They did after my contributions.

0:14:35.540,0:14:40.420
And they invited me to JSConf EU, thanks to Mozilla. When I saw the environment I said:

0:14:40.420,0:14:43.700
"This is the thing I should be part of, I should really pay more attention to this environment"

0:14:43.960,0:14:45.380
So that's my breaking point.

0:14:45.500,0:14:47.340
[Doğukan] Do you have a notable, exciting story?

0:14:47.500,0:14:48.880
[Burak] Yes.
[Doğukan] Tell us.

0:14:49.200,0:14:51.080
Well my notable, exciting story is all about how I got to know my wife.

0:14:51.080,0:14:56.100
I was writing code at the high school. An encryption tool called NTCrypto written Delphi.

0:14:56.100,0:14:58.620
You can even find it online on some weird sites such as gezginler.com.

0:14:59.740,0:15:03.800
Then I put it online, wrote my name into its about section as well as my 2 e-mail addresses.

0:15:04.020,0:15:07.080
Back then there was MSN, very widely used. One of those e-mail addresses was, in fact, my MSN address.

0:15:07.080,0:15:08.500
Anyways, I put it online.

0:15:08.820,0:15:13.200
My wife is older than me by the way and she was trying to complete her thesis by the time. And I was first grade.

0:15:13.720,0:15:18.320
And her thesis was on encryption. She found my encryption tool, saw my name and added me on MSN.

0:15:18.700,0:15:23.660
She would delete me after getting my help and we would never talk again.

0:15:23.900,0:15:30.220
Luckily, we had a technical drawing session that day so we went to the lab and I knew that there is a security breachon the system,

0:15:30.500,0:15:33.200
I had a disk with me called NT Password Reset Disk.

0:15:33.660,0:15:38.360
When you boot the computer with that disk, it boots with Linux

0:15:38.360,0:15:40.240
and allows you to reset NT's admin password.

0:15:40.960,0:15:42.960
Otherwise you cannot do anything on that computer besides drawing.

0:15:43.320,0:15:45.680
So I had my disk and reset the password.

0:15:46.180,0:15:50.860
I had access to the desktop, was able to change the wallpaper, show off my friends etc..

0:15:50.860,0:15:55.840
Then I installed MSN and got online. And by that time, she saw me online right before she was about the leave her office.

0:15:56.280,0:15:56.780
[Doğukan] Super!

0:15:56.840,0:16:01.780
There we started to talk and now we're married. And we know each other since 10 years.

0:16:01.780,0:16:03.620
[Doğukan] Awesome, perfect!
[Burak] Yes, it's an amazing story.

0:16:04.580,0:16:09.940
[Doğukan] What do you do besides work? I mean, I'm asking this because Burak Can had this post on his blog,

0:16:09.940,0:16:13.940
[Doğukan] about people in this sector hanging out, gathering etc.. But it's always about work, work, work..

0:16:13.940,0:16:19.480
[Doğukan] so he was teasing "Don't know something else?" while tagging Fatih and other guys in the post.

0:16:19.480,0:16:24.120
[Doğukan] So I originate the question from his post. I assume you don't always work, I mean I hope?

0:16:24.300,0:16:26.840
[Doğukan] Erm, so what do you do besides work or do you have hobbies?

0:16:27.160,0:16:31.320
LEGO. I still love playing with LEGO no matter how old I'm. And the second thing is photography.

0:16:31.840,0:16:35.040
Sometimes I play some music by myself. I've a little electronic battery at home.

0:16:35.040,0:16:38.020
And I also like riding my bicycle. Thankfully, I started riding it again.

0:16:39.020,0:16:39.620
And that's it..

0:16:39.780,0:16:45.420
I know Doğukan for a while. I'm following his work closely. I think this developer talks video series is a great idea.

0:16:45.420,0:16:50.260
Therefore, erm, you should click here to subscribe.

0:16:50.620,0:16:52.620
Follow him and I'll continue to follow.

0:16:52.620,0:16:54.620
[Doğukan] Thanks.
