00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,620
I've been following Atolye15 for a long time.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,500
The things they do in Izmir is truly beautiful.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,900
I actually gave the said presentation about Flexible Grid System at Atolye15, too.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,300
They took it pretty well. I'm sending a mail to a firm in Izmir.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,320
Saying that I have this project and I want to show it to them.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,300
They graciously inviting me to their office and I'm giving a presentation to them.

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:36,580
They are such a gracious firm and open to new technologies.

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:44,600
To be honest, I was pretty happy with the fact that there is such a firm in Izmir.

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:55,000
That they treat us like one of their own and providing opportunities eventhough we were strangers to them.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,240
Also WTK was pretty awesome. They filled that lack of conferences in Izmir.

11
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,340
It's awesome because people can meet and stay in touch with many others here.

12
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,120
They get to know about new things in industry.

13
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,120
The first presentation was pretty good.

14
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,780
I'm sure the rest will be, as well.

15
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,800
Special thanks to Atolye15 for everything.
