[Doğukan] Now everyone has been asking..

0:00:02.320,0:00:05.140
[Doğukan] Let me ask it before the question would be raised again

0:00:05.260,0:00:07.300
[Doğukan] How did you manage to get "f" username from GitHub?

0:00:07.300,0:00:07.860
Here's what happened..

0:00:08.020,0:00:13.220
So I had this username: "fkadeveloper", a GitHub username and it was too long.

0:00:13.400,0:00:15.660
I mean really long.. Then I shortened it by "fkadev".

0:00:15.800,0:00:19.620
And even my twitter (etc.) handles are "fkadev"

0:00:19.620,0:00:25.820
I'm not that happy with it though but people got used to call me "fkadev" and therefore I cannot change it. It really stuck with me.

0:00:25.820,0:00:30.860
That "dev" thing, by the way, comes from this.. It was "developer" at first. The reason I made it "dev" is because it's short

0:00:30.860,0:00:37.160
as well as I was using Linux back then and the packages' development names had "-dev" in them: apache, apache-dev.

0:00:37.160,0:00:42.900
So that's the reason.. totally.. And I though why not make it just "dev", afterall I'm a developer.

0:00:42.900,0:00:44.900
And I made it "dev" and that's the way it's.

0:00:44.900,0:00:48.960
Because "fka" is too short I'm not able to use it for some services.

0:00:49.360,0:00:53.360
And "fka" is actually my initials: Fatih Kadir Akın. Not really creative though.

0:00:53.360,0:00:55.700
But you know; I couldn't find something else and I decided to stick with it.

0:00:55.700,0:01:00.400
And then I emailed to... you name it.. Emailed to GitHub Support.

0:01:00.400,0:01:06.320
I told them: "I want the name fka". By the time there was already an inactive username as "fka".

0:01:06.500,0:01:12.140
And they gave it to me right away. 10 minutes later they deleted the user "fka" and got back to me saying: "There, now you can take it".

0:01:12.140,0:01:15.960
I said: "Aha, nice". But then a friend, can't remember who, sorry for that.

0:01:15.960,0:01:19.840
"This.." he said "..would go until you get the f". I checked and found out that "f" is inactive too.

0:01:20.760,0:01:25.140
This time I replied to my own email saying: "Thank you for allowing me to get fka but..."

0:01:25.140,0:01:30.080
"...f is inactive as well. Can I take it?". And 10 minutes later I got an email saying: "sure you can".

0:01:30.680,0:01:32.680
Then they gave me access to "f" and that's it.

0:01:32.680,0:01:33.800
I didn't even bother.

0:01:34.580,0:01:37.560
And it's great. It's a very prestigious name.

0:01:37.560,0:01:41.020
By prestigious I mean: Now I'm typing just "f" when I'm asked for my password during commiting new code.

0:01:41.800,0:01:43.800
You just request it. It's not the end of the world.

0:01:44.920,0:01:48.520
And the good part of it is that I now have the name "f". And of course, on other platforms

0:01:48.520,0:01:53.720
where GitHub login is being used I'm "f" again. CodePen for instance.

0:01:54.420,0:01:56.760
But, of course, "f" doesn't work for all services.

0:01:56.760,0:01:58.760
So I've my own fallbacks: "f", "fka", "fkadev".

0:01:59.440,0:02:03.740
[Doğukan] Just one thing.. You had a project with some shortname or a repo I guess..

0:02:03.740,0:02:05.740
[Doğukan] r... r3, was it?

0:02:06.280,0:02:07.480
Yes yes.. I mean...

0:02:07.860,0:02:10.200
[Doğukan] I'm just having this trouble. I can't click on it.

0:02:10.360,0:02:13.840
[Doğukan] Can't decide where to click.. The profile or the repo. That's the only problem.

0:02:13.840,0:02:17.520
Because they're short, yes. I even now this another project...

0:02:17.520,0:02:19.940
...called "pq" which makes "f/pq". Just 3 characters.

0:02:20.640,0:02:25.480
Yeah, it's good. Many advantages. Although looks like there are disadvantages as well like you said.. Cannot click etc..
